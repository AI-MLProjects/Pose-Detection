# Pose Detection in the Browser: PoseNet Model
Pose Detection by using Web (Mobile / Laptop) Camera

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm
that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video. So far we
will use the single person Image/video to estimate the pose.
